## UI Features

### Dark Theme
Redis Studio uses a modern dark theme optimized for long sessions.

### State Persistence
Your preferences are saved across browser sessions:
- Selected database
- Active tab
- Search patterns

### Responsive Design
Works on desktop and tablet devices with adaptive layouts.

## Tips & Best Practices

### Searching Keys Efficiently

Use SCAN instead of KEYS for large databases:
```
redis> SCAN 0 MATCH user:* COUNT 100
```

### Monitoring Memory

Regular memory analysis helps identify:
- Large keys consuming resources
- Memory fragmentation issues
- Keys without expiration (potential memory leaks)

### Lua Script Caching

For frequently-used scripts:
1. Load the script once with "Load Script"
2. Save the returned SHA
3. Execute using EVALSHA for better performance

### Security Best Practices

- Use ACL to restrict user permissions
- Monitor ACL log for unauthorized access attempts
- Set appropriate TTLs to prevent memory issues
- Use TLS for remote connections
